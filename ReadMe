Main concepts in this repository:
	Basic Inheritance
	Generics
	Closures
	Comparators
	Basic sorting functions on small data sets
	
Note: In LSD Radix Sort, there's some questionable stuff with generics (Assuming the type is an Integer). 
		I am aware of that. At this point I'm only using the Integer class as the type passed to the sorting objects.
